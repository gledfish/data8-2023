## The Book's Software

Inferential Thinking is built upon several software libraries which are actively maintained. The main library used to build the book is called [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), which is also the same software used to create this Zero-to-Data-8 guide! The language used to teach the course is Python, and is supplemented using a library called `datascience`, which is a library authored by [John Denero](http://denero.org/), David Culler, Alvin Wan, and Sam Lau. The library's source code can be found at the attached link [here](https://pypi.org/project/datascience/).
