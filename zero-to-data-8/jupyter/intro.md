# Jupyter Notebook Assignments

>"The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more."
>[-Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

In Data 8, teaching and student collaboration on the projects is largely carried out with **Jupyter Notebooks**, which allows one to combine narrative and computational content in the same document. Jupyter Notebooks are *runnable*, meaning that students can edit them, interact with them, and generally explore with them *live* on the DataHub. They allow for interactive visualizations and immediate feedback, which are essential in the Data 8 teaching philosophy.
